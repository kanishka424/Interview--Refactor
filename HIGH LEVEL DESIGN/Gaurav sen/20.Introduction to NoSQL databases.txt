difference betwenn nosql and sql




NOSQL
advantage
1.good for insertion and retrievel
2.schema is easily changblea
3.buuilt for scalibilty(availbilty over consistency)/shardding/vertical partitioning
4.buitl for aggregation-average salary etc...


disavantage
1,not good if lots of updates are there
2.data may not be consistent(ACID NOT MAINTAINED)(IN SQL ACID IS MAINAINED)
3,not read optimized
4.no implicit info about realtion
5)joins are harder



nosql if

aggreagation
