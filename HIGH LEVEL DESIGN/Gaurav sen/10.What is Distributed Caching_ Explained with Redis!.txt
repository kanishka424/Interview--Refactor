THI IS NOT DETILED


e.g-if the same profile is asked again
we can keep an in memeory cache key and value pair
1.THIS REDUCES NETWORK CALLS



WHEN YOU NEED AVERAGE AGE OF THE PEOPLE IN A DATABASE
RATHE R THAN GOING AND CALCULATING THE AGE EVERY TIME WE CAN JUST GET THE THE VALUE AND STORE IN CACHE
2.AVOID RECOMPUTATION

3.WHEN YOU NEED TO AVOID HITTING THE DB EVERY TIME
BY using a cache we can direct some request to cache rather than hiting DB


summary why we need cache//firt two are the priority
1.THIS REDUCES NETWORK CALLS
2.AVOID RECOMPUTATION
3.reduce db load

these help you speed up responses
your client make requests and you immidietly give response if you have it on cache,without making a query to db


BUT WE CANT KEEP EVERYTHING ON CACHE INSTEAD OF DB
1.BECAUSE THE hw(USUALLY SSD) IS MUCH EXPENSIVE THAN OF A NORAML DB(USUSALLY COMAPCT MEMEORY)
2.IF YOU STORE TON OF DAATA IN CACHE search times wILL INCREASE SO IT WOULD MAKE LESSER AND LESSER SENSE TO STORE DATA IN CAHE

**DSTORE ALL DATA IN DB AND STORE
CACHE NEEDS TO HAVE DATA MORE RELVENT TO FUTURE WHICH ARE GOING TO COME IN FUTURE
]NOW FOR THIS WE NEED TO PREDICT 
TWO THINGS
1.WHEN DO I LOAD INTO CACHE
2.WHEN DO I EVICT FROM CACHE

THIS IS DONE USING A "POLICY" WHICH IS A "CACHE POLICY"

THERE ARE MULTIPE POLICIES
1.LRU (LEAST RECENTLY UED)-WHEN EVER STORING DATA STORE ON TOP AND EVICT BELOW ENTRIES
FIRST ENTRIES ON TOP CAN BE SECONDS AGO AND BOTTOM DATA CAN BE HOURS /DAYS AGO
E.G- WHEN A CELEBRITY RECENTLY MAAKES A CPOST YOU KEEP IT IN CACHE AND WHEN ITS OLDER COOL YOU JUST KICKED IT OUT

2.LFU(LEAST FREQUENTLY USED)
NOT FREQUENTLY USED IN REAL WORLD

WITH POOR EVICTION POLICY ITS HARMEFUL TO HABVE CACHE
PROBLEMS
1)EVICT CACHE
2)THRASHING
3)


TIME 6.50 WHERE TO PUT THE CACHE


9.40 -WRITE THOUGH OR WRITE BACK CACHE
