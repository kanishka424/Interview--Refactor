uing databses as esag queues  i an anti patternAVOID IT!!!


DB CANT TALK TO OTHER APPLICATON SERVER SO APPLICATIONS NEED TO PULL DATA FROM DB FOR EXAMPLE EVERY 10 SENONDS ETC..(THIS IS CALLED PULLING INTERVAL 10SECONDS)



TIME 1.58 A DB I UED AS A QUEUE TO COMMUNICATE DATA BETWEEN S3 TO S2(FROM S3 TO S2)

WHY IS THIS AN ANTI PATTERN??

FREQUENT POLLING MEANS LOT OF LOAD ON DB
IF  POLL AT LONG INTERVAL MAYBE S2 WANTSS DATA QUICKLY TO DELIVER TO MOBILE SO USER EXPERINCE IS BAD INEFFICEINT

DB IS EITHER OPTIMEZED FOR WRITING OR READING IF BOTH HA BEEN PERFORMEED ON DBS IT IS GOING TO HAVE ISSUES LIKE LOCKING,DEAD LOCKING

IN CRUD MODEL(CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE) WE ARE GOING TO DECIDE HOW MUCH TIME EACH OPERATION WILL TAKE


WAHT IF S1,S2,S3 APPLICATION SERVERS ARE EXCAHNING FREQUENTLY O THIS DB WILL FILL UP
BECAUE OF ENTRIES

SO YOU HAVE TO CLEAR THOSE DATA IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO  YOU NEED TO UPDATE AND MARK IT AS COMPLETED  THTS AN EXPENSIVE OPERATION
OR TO MANUALLY DELETE DATA FRO TATH WE MIGHT HAVE TO USE COMPLICATED SCRIPTS


ANOTHE RPROBLEM IS  SCALBILITY(TIME 4.57)


****INSTEAD OF SERVER APPLICATION ASKING MESSAGE QUEUE WILL GIVE IT TOSERVER*****


THERE ARE OPTIMIZE  IN THE SENSE THERE ARE NO READING OPERATIONS SO WRITING TO IT IS EASY WHILE READING IS ACTUALLY MESSAGE QUEUES RESPONSIBILTY IN ITS OWN FREE TIME


SCALIBILTIY IS TAKEN CARE YOU CAN PUT MORE MONEY AND INCREASE
