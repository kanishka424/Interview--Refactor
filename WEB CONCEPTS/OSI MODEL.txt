OSI-Open System Interconnection 

OSI model-defines how two computers communicate over network 


In most basic form two computers connected With Lan cables and connectors(RJ45) and sharing data with NIC cards

but if one is Windows other is Mac OS how will they communicate??

OSI MODEL
1.Application
2.Presentation
3.Session
4.Transport
5.Network
6.DataLink
7.Physical


Each layer above is a PACKAGE OF PROTOCOLS
when we say Application layer it doesnt include applications like chrome or firefox but it includes application layer protocols that need to make friefox,chrome,etc.. like applications make correctly in internet

1.APPLICATION LAYER

APplication Layer is used by Network Applications
Network applications means applications that uses internet that are chrome,firefox,outlook,skype,etc.....
web browser is an application that runs on PC it doesnt reside on application layer but it uses 
applications level protocols like HTTP,HTTPs to do web surfing
all network applications are dependent on Application layer protocols that enables various function at thislevel

APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOLS
HTTP
HTTPS
FTP
NFS
FMTP
DHCP
SNMP
TELNET
IRC
NNTP
POP3

These protocls provide basis for functions like 
FILE transfer 	-FTP
web surfing		-HTTP/HTTPS
Emails			-SMTP
virtual terminals-TELNET

2.PRESENTATION LAYER
I)recives data fro application layers 
these data are in form of CHARACTERS and NUMBERS
PRESENTATION LAYER CONVERT THESES DATA TO FORM OF BINARY WHICH MACHINES CAN UNDERSTAND
E.G-ASCII TO EBCDIC
THIS PART IS CALLED TRANSLATION(SEE VIDEO 2.57 FORIMAGE)
II)BEFORE TRANSMISSION PRESENTATION LAYERS REDUCES THE NUMBERS OF BITS THAT ARE TO REDUCE ORIGINAL DATA
this is called DATA COMPRESSION
IT can be 
1.Lossy
2.Lossless

III).when data is reduces it requires less transmission time
DATA COMPRESSION  is useful rela time video and audio
to keep intergrity of data data is encrypted

in senders it is encrypted and recivers it is decrypted
SSL i (Secure Socket Layer) is used 


SO ABOVE DISCUSSED PRESENTATION LAYER FUNCTIONS
1.TRANSLATIONA
2.DATA COMPRESSION
3.ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION

3)SESSION LAYER
THINK OF IT AS PARTY ORGANIZER/HELPERS THEY WILL MANAGE AND CLOSE THE PARTY
this is a cobination of connections and sessions
Helpers for the Session layer is its APIs
e.g-NETBIOS(allows computers to communicate over network)
just before connection is establish with server ,server performs  a function called AUTHENTICATION
AUTHENTICATION-aking hwo you are?
we usally give our user Name and Password
oncae the credentials are matched a session is established between client and server

affter AUTHENTICATION AUTHORIZATION is checked
AUTHORIZATION-what access rights you have


image,ffiles,etc..downloading will open a seperate session and this session will send thoe images,files,etc,,, as data packets 
SESSION LAYER KEEPS OF THE TRACK WHICH DATA PACKET BELONGS TO WHICH FILE EITHER TEXT,IMAGE,ETC.. AND TRACKS WHERE THE DATA PACKET GOES WEB BROWSER(SESION MANAGMENT)

FUNCTIONALITES OF SESSION Laye

1.AUTHENTICATION
2.AUTHORIZATION
3.SESSION MANAGMENT



4.TRANSPORTATION LAYER 

keeps RELIABILTY of communication with 
1.SEGMENTATION
2.FLOW CONTROL
3.ERROR CONTROL


HERE data received through SESSION layer is divide to small data called SEGMENTS/DATA UNIT

DATA UNIT HAS
I)SEQUENCE NUMBERS-COLLECTS AND RE-ASSEMBLES DATA IN RIGHT ORDER TO FORM CORRECT MESSAGE AT RECEIVER
II)PORT NUMBER-HELPS TO DIRECT TO THE CORRECT APPLICATION



FLOW CONTROL 
TL CONTROLE THE AMONT OF DATA  TRANSFORMED XXXX Mbps


if the erver has 100Mbps and client mobile has 10Mbps
if the Server send 50Mbps but client can only take 10Mbps 
WTH THE HELP OF TL CLIENT CAN SAY I CAN ONLY RECEIVE DATA 10 Mbps AND SERVER WILL SEND 10Mbps SO NO DATA GETS LOST
SAME HAPPENS IF SERVER SEND 5MbPS SO CLIENT CAN TELL i NEED 10Mbps TO MAINTAIN SYSTEM PERFORMANCE SO SERVER WOULD GIVE SO

ERROR CONTROL
7.50-IMAGE

IF DATA DIDNT ARRIVE "AUTOMATIC REPEAT REQUEST" IS USED 
"CHECKSUM"IS USED IF CORRUPTED DATA IS RECEIVED


PROTOCOLS
Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)
USer Datagram Protocol(UDP)

services
1)connection oriented transport-TCP
2)Connectionless Transmission-UDP

UDP is faster than TCP
because it doesnt provide any feedback whether data is recived but TCP do provide feedback 
THERFOR LOST DATA CAN BE RE TRNSMITTED IN TCP


SO UDP IS USED WHERE THE DATA RECIVED INFORMATION DOESNT MATTER
E.G-MOVIES
MUSIC
VIDEO GAMES
DNS
TTFP
VOICE OF ip


TCP IS USED WHER WHOLE DATA DELIVERY IS MUST

WWW
FTP
EMAIL

5)NETWORK LAYER

WORKS FOR TRANSMISSION OF SEGMENTEDD DATA TO FROM ONE COMPUTER TOOTHER RESIDES IN ANOTHER NETWORK

DATA UNITS IN NETWORK ARE CALLED PACKETS

FUNCTIONALITES1.LOGICAL ADDRESSING
2.PATH DETERMINATION
3,ROUTING
