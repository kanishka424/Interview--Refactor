"Scope is mechnis in Oauth 2.0 to limit an application to a user account.
An application can requet one or more scope,this information is then presented to then
user in the consent screen and the acces token issued to the application will be to the scope grnted"


we have a uer,authorization server.client application(moblie,desktop ,web,etc..) and phot album reource server

time 0.57 image

client application can request for a list of users photo albums 

in resource server there can be protected photo,privat photo,protected albums

to get intoprivate or protected you need an acess token


in initital GET request you need to add "cope" query parameter
e.get
...&scope=openId profile protected-photo-albums

to get into protected albums my application needs to add the scope "protected-photo-album" 



the same flow lite======


protected-photo-album this scope would say tath client have the  necessary rights to access  the protected album in resource server


protected-photo-album  IS A CUSTOM SCOPE!!!
 WE ALREADY UED COPES LIKE "openId" and "profile"
 
 "openId" and "profile" are open ID scopes
 


openId is a layer on top of Oauth 2 that enables clients application to verify  an id of an end user as well as obtain some basic info about end user
so with this two scopes openId and profile I would like to obtain some basic info about my client application


 "openId" and "profile" are standard open ID scopes
 
 
 1.openId-informs authorization server thT CLIENT APPLICATION IS MAKING AN OPEN ID CONNECT REQUEST
 THIS WILL ALSO MAKE AUTHORIZATION SERVER ADDITIONALLY RETURN AN ID TOKEN WITH THE ACESS TOKEN
 
THE ID TOKEN WILL CONTAIN USER DETAILS SPECIFIED BY ABOVE TWO SCOPES


2.profile-it would say thath it like to have access to user profile 
user profile contains name,family name,middle name,et..... but it doesnt contain email address 
email iss a seperate scope

 
 time 5.45-7.00 open id standr scopes
 
 openId
 profile
 email
 address
 phone 
 offline_access
 
 
 the info theses scopes return can be configured in server side and also you can define you custom scope
 
 
 
 once you have the acces token(one or all of the scopes) you should be able to get
 you should be able to get user info from  either by id token or by sendingthe request to uer information web service end point taht your authorization serer will expose
 
 
 
 tto get it we need to send HTTP request to /userinfo end point
 
 
 
/userinfo end point is provided by your oauth server it is part of oauth specifications


but it may differ depending on Oauth server
