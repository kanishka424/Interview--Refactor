YOU WILL LEARN WHAT ROLE AND AUTHORITIES ARE
how they work in pring boot server and how to validate roles using spring boot

there is no much difference between role and authorities in sopring boot
how do software developers most of the time organize roles and athoroties


softwwares have diferenr users
regualr users
admin
super admin etc..

all these are roles

privialges or authoroties

1.regualr users-view profile,view others profile,edit own profile
2.admin-view profile,view other's profiles,edit own profile,edit others profile,delete other users


3.super admin-view profile,view other's profiles,edit own profile,edit others profile,delete other users,DELETE EDIT OTHER ADMINS


privalage==authority



A ROLES IS A COLLECTION OF AUTHORTIES
ONE ROLE CAN HAVE ONE OR MORE AUTHORITES


A USER WITH ONE ROLE CAN HAVE MORE OR LESS AUTHORITIES COMPARE TO ANOTHER USER WITH A DIFFERENT ROLE

BUT FOR SPRING ;FRAME WORK THERE IS NO MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AUTHORITY AND ROLE


TECHNICALLY PRING FRAME WORK DOESNT PROVIDE WITH SEPERATE APIS TO CREATE ROLES AND ADD AUTHORITES TO THOSE
IN SPRING SECURITY ROLES AND AUTHORITES ARE IN A SINGLE LISRT

WE CAN KEEP AUTHORITES IN A DATABAE BUT WHEN WE READ WE PUT INTO SINGLE LIST THEN IT BECOME A SINGLE COLLECTION OF GRANTED AUTHORITES

THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN ROLE AND AUTHORITIES ARE THERE NAME


WHEN CREATING ROLE NAMES DEVELOPERS ADD "ROLE_" PREFIX TO THE ROLE NAME
E.G-authority name=Role name=ROLE_ADMIN

when checking for roles developer can use "hasRole()" function  in sprin security\
e.g-haROle("ADMIN")


to check authoroties we can use "hasAuthority()" function in spring boot

eg- hasAuthority("ROLE_ADMIN")//HERE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE PREFIX BECAUE IT I CHECKING FOR AUTHORITES AND WILL NOT AUTMATICALL ADD"ROLE_" PREFIX


BOTH FUNCTION WOULD USE THE AME SOURCE TO LOOK FOR AN AUTHORITY OR ROLEE
(TIME 4.39)
SO ANY OF THE FUNCTION USED IT WILL USE THE SAME GrantedAuthority(the source) which will create and give
difference is hasRole("ADMIN") will add the ROLE_ prefix automaticcally


Collection<GrantedAuthority> the source

ROLES-
ROLE_USER
ROLE_ADMIN
ROLE_DBADMIN


AUTHORITES
READ
WRITE
DELETE
