$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$1.Introduction$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Grant type is a way an application gets an access token
depending on the  application and use case  a specifice OAuth grant type can be used

there can be a "server side web app" built using JAva or PHP  using specific grant type
there can be a "server side script with no ui" this kind of application can use different kinf of grant type to acquire an access token 
application can be alsso of "javascript single page app" or it can be  a "native mobile app" or can be a "device" application(like playstatuion) etc..

because there are different applications and different level of security to those apps there are different grant types that suits each

each grant type is ued to access token in slightly different way
eg-

there is a grant type called 'AUTHORIZATION CODE' this gratn type is often used in service side applications
e.g-server side awen app,Mobile native app


there is also a grant type called "CLIENT CREDENTIALS"
used in SERVER side script with no UI with not DIRECTLY AVAILABLE TO END USER


THERE IS ALSO AN EXTENTION TO "AUTHORIZATION CODE" GRANT TYPE caalled "PKCE ENHANCED AUTHORIZATION CODE"   
used in application that CANT KEEP CLIENT CREDENTIALS CONFIDENTIAL
THIS CAN BE JAVASCRIPT APPLICATION FOR EXAMPLE OR ALSO MOBILE APPLICATIONS




THERE IS A GRANT TYPE CALLE "DEVEICE' THAT CANT OPEN A BROWER WINDOW 
OR EXECUTE A CODE ON THE SERVER SIDE


THERE ARE SOME GRANT TYPE WHICH ARE DEPRECTED BUT YOU WILL ENCOUNTER WORKING AT LEGECY SYTEM ONE OF THEM "IMPLICITE FLOW"
USED IN JS APPLICATION AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS 
"IMPLICITE FLOW" RETURNS AN ACCES TOKEN IMMEDIATLY WITHOUT EXTRA AUTHORIZATION STEP


ANOTHER DEPERECATE AND NOT RECOMMENDED GRANT TPYE IS "PASWORD GRANT'
HELPS TO EXCHANGE USER CREDENTIALS FOR AN ACCES TOKEN
ITS THE CLIENT APP THAT HAS TO HOLD THE PW AND MAKE THE EXCHANGE


THERE  IS ALSO "REFRESH TOKEN" GRANT TYPE
EXCHANGE REFRESH TOKEN T FOR AN ACCESS TOKEN



****GRANT TYPES*****

1.AUTHORIZATION CODE
2.CLIENT CREDENTIALS
3.PKCE ENHANCED AUTHORIZATION CODE
4.DEVICE(DEVEICE IS NOT THE NAME)


***DEPRECATED GRANT TYPES********
5.IMPLICITE FLOW
6.PASWORD GRANT
7.REFRESH TOKEN



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$2. Authorization Code. Introduction.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

YOU have expirenced this when YOU GRANT AN MOBILE APPLICATION/WEB TO ACCESS YOUR FACE BOOK  OR GOOGLE FOR EXAMPLE
THIS IS A REDIRECTION BAED FLOW

TO USE this flow declines application for examle  a website must be capable of handling ypiiur right redirects from the authorization server
and additionally to be able to handle your redirects the client application must be able to securely the client ecret that it will be using when excahnging in the authorizaton code for  an access token
IF THE CLIENT APPLICATION CANT GURANTEE  THE CONFIDENTILITY OF SECRET KEY  
THEN IT SHOULD NOT UE "AUTHORIZATION CODE GRANT" INSTEAD IT SHOULD USE "PKCE ENAHNCED AUTHORIZATION CODE" 

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT MOBILE APPLICATION ,SINGLE PAGE JS APPLICATIONS USE "PKCE ENAHNCED AUTHORITAZITON" CODE


BUT IF YOUR APPLICATION IS A SERVER BASED WEB APPLICATION  IT IS CAPABLE OF SECURLY  STORING OAUTH SECRET KEY IN SERVER THEN AUTHORITAZITON CODE GRANT CAN BEUED



TIME 01.45 -HOW AUTHORIZATION CODE GRANT WORKING

A WEBSITE UER ALLOWS A WEBSITE TO CONNECT TO THEIR FB AND FETCH SOME DATA (TIME 01.56 IMAGE)
SO THEY WIIL CLICK "CONNECT MY FB" BUTTON(Click on a link in IMAGE) and WEBITE WILL REDIRECT USER TO AN AUTHORIZATION SERVER URL  (Authorization code request) TO FB(AUTHORIZATIION SERVER) .THIS URL WILL CONTAIN OME REQUEST PARMETERE (TIME 02.075 IMAGE)
following are those
1.repsponse_type=code//THE VALUE IS 'CODE' NOT ANUMBER EXACTLY THE WORD 'CODE'
the first url parameter  is "response_code" and for "AUTHORITAZITON CODE GRANT" THE  VALUE IS 'code' to let know the authorization serrver type of OAuth we use
and it will indicate that  curent application will accept receving from Authorizaion server and "authorization code" 


2.stae=hv8hf0h2i7d

random alpha numeric characters  our application will generate  and it will include in the request
the authorization erver will send us back this stae parmeter and it must be exactly the  same  
if they differe some one else have initiate this request


3.redirect_uri={redirect_uri}

this is a uri that Authorization server would redirect user next if authorization is succesful
and the client application must be capbale of handling this


4.scope={Scopes}

lit of scopes 
for examples read folder or reead videos
indicates the client information a app can access behalf of the user once authorization is successful


5.client_id={client id}

a client identifier not a user identifier to identify a user who tries to log in
JUst a client identifier of our client
in later viceos we will learn it actaull before authorizing the client sholud register with Authorization server and acquier ID and  secret key

end of parmeter rquestss


Once the authrization server receives and validate this request(time 4.42)

IT WILL THEN PRESENT USER WITH LOGIN PAGE (TIME 4.45 IMAGE)
WHERE YOU NEED TO PROVIDE WITH YOUR UN AND PW TO AUTNTICATE (NOT AUTORIZE) WITH YOU AUTRIZATION SERVER
ONCE USER  SUCCESFULLY AUTHENTICATE WITH AUTHORITAZITON SERVVER AUTHORITAZITON SERVER WILL GENERATE A SHORT LIVED  AUTHORIZATION CODE AND IT WILL REDIRECT THAT USER TO TO A PROVIDED URI (TIME 05.15) AND IT WILL A TTACHED THIS REDIRECT URI TEO REQUEST PARAMETERS "code" and "state"
the code rquestss parameter wil contain a short lived code and which will be generated by authorization server it i recommended the life sapn of this code must be maximum 10 minutes the code must be UNIQUE and not to use more than  one time.



URI-redirct_uri?code={4fgh7sn}&state={CSFR} //see this between authorization server and website/client
state mut be same as one from request the request (the first arrow inIMAGE) 

we must va9date it 
now our client has authorization code and it can exchange that for a ACCESS TOKEN

IT WILL SEND HTTP POT REQUEST TO AUTHORIZATION SERVER  PROVIDING AUTHORITAZITONSERVER WITH VALUE OF authorization code('code") that wa generated by the authorization server and providing it with the same(arrow line 3 from web to AS)
value of redirect uri to which it has redirected th ecode

and then the authorization will validate the request(3rd arrow)  and response back with a JSON THAT WILL CONTAIN ACCES TOKEN

THEN WEB/CLIENT CAN ACCE THE RESOURCES WITH WEB TOKEN AND THE RSOURCE SERVER WILL VALIDATE THE TOKEN WITH AUTH SERVER


LETS LOOK AT THE FLOW USING ONE MORE DIAGRAM(TIME 6.41)
THIS DIAGRAM EXPLAIN EVERTHING IN SUMMARY(TIME 8.570







$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$3. Authorization Code Demo. Initial Request.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



WATCHING THE VIDEO IS THE BEST WAY

BECAUSE WE USE "GET" HERE ALL THE QUERY PARAMS GET APPENDED TO URL
SO AT THE END INSTED OF RUNIING POSTMAN WE CAN GET THE URL AND RUN IT ON BROWSER

THIS WILL PROVIDE A PAGE TO LOGIN (TIME 6.28)


WITH SUCESFUL LOGIN YOU ARE REDIRECTED TO THE URI YOU SENT IN URL PARAMETERS(TIME 6.44)

SEE THE URL OF THE BROWSER

COPY AND PASTE IT TO A NOTEPAD (SEE THE VIDEO)
'state't have the same value as we send in request url
'code' have the value for authorization code THAT NEEDS TO BE EXCHANGED FOR AN ACCESS TOKEN


CONTD.......

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4. Authorization Code Demo. Exchange code for Access token.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
WATCHING THE VIDEO IS THE BEST WAY

LETS EXCHANGEET THIS AUTHORIZATION CODE(VALUE ASIGNED TO 'code')  For an access token
(time 0.15)

here we are using 'POST' 

FOR THE VALUE OF "code" WE PROVIDE THE AUTHORIZATION CODE WE RECEIVED

TIME 02.46 THE COMPLETE HTTP POST SENT TO AUTHORIZATION SERVER


TIME 03.49 -WE GET ACCESS TOKEN IN EXCHANGE FOR AUTHORIZATION CODE(access_token) which is base 64 encoded
we have  refresh token,id token,etc...

all these are inside a JSON




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$5. PKCE-enhanced Authorization Code$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


PKCE-Proof Key for Code Exchange

built on top of standered AUTHORISATION CODE 

most used by native and JS apps 
provides additional level of security to apps that cant keep the confidentiality of its OAuth secret key
e.g-JS single page application
single page JS application cant keep the Oauth secret key saftely
it cant gurntee its confidentaility
this is because developers can preview the JS code in browser and see the secret key
becaue JS page cant secure the secret key it cant use secret key
as an alternative it makes user with own secret key 
which it need s to generae in a way the authorizartion server can verify


this proces is caled proof key  for coolish change or Berkesi in hands authorization code

stepps in t his  floor are very similar to the regualr authorization code flow 
except that now thew CLIENT APPLICATION NEEDST O FENERATE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL REQUEST PARAMETERS


TIME 1.45-LETS SEE HOW IT WORKS

ADDITIONAL ARMETERS

1.code_challenge
2.code_challenge_method


1.code_challenge
a base 64 encoded value there is a specific vway of generating this value
(will see the way later)there is a special way the client app generates this value

to generate"code_challenge" value the application must first generate "code_verifier"
and client use "code_verifier" to derive "code_challenge"
the code_verifiervalue declare the value need to be stored and then ue latter in the flow

2.code_challenge_method

need to be configured in authorizartion server for client application

two vaues can be assigned
1.s256//type of cryptographic hash fiunction that will be used to hash tthe verifyer ccode
2."plain"
no hashing is used for cryptographic hash function taht would be to verify hash function
time 3,32 LOST IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$6.Generating Code Verifier$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


here we will dicus how to generate code verifier value which helps to generate "code_ challenge"(discussed in previous video)
you can read the cOauth protoocl document on how client  create a code verifier
basically this is a rando alpjhanumerics with min length of 43 characters
maximum length of 128 cahracters
these cahracters must be url safe and  base 64 encoded


TIME 00.337-HOW TO IMpLMENT IT IN JAVA//see the below code with libraries
#########################code############################
public class PkceUtil{
String generateCodeVerifier() throws UnsupportedEncodingException{
SecureRandom secureRandom=new SecureRandom();
byte[] codeVerififer=new byte[32];
secureRandom.nextBytes(codeVerififer);
retrun
Base64.getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding().encodeTOString(codeVerifier);
}

###########################################################

BASICALLY WE GENERATE RANDOM BYTES AND CONVERT THEM TO STREAMS
AND BASE64 ENCODED USING BASE64 SAFE URL ENCODER
THE FUNCTION WOULD RETURN  A STRING SIMILAR TO -SEE TIME 01.05 BOTTOM
THIS WOULD BE THE CODE VERIFIER value that ned to be used requet to excahnge authorization code for an access token 

 
#######################7..Generating Code Challenge#####################################################


we need "c;ode verifier" value to generrate "code challenge" value,we did this in previous video
there is a ection in OAuth "client creates the code challenge"

uing s256(recomendded)
code_challenge=BAE64URl-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))//THIS WAS TAKEN FROM OAUTH DOC

ABOVE STEPS NEEDED TO GENERATE "code_challenge"
1.GENERATE 'code_verifier' VALUE
2.ENCODE IT USING ASCII CODING
3.GET A HASH  VALUE USING SHA256 CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTION
4.BASE64 ENCODE USING "BASE64 SFAE URL ENCODING"

 
##################JAVA CODE#########################
STRING grenerateCodeChallange(String codeVerifier) throws UnsupportedEncodingException,NoSuchAlgorithmException{
byte[] bytes=codeVerifier.getBytes("US-ASCII");
MessageDigest messageDigest=MessageDigest.getInstnace("SHA-256");
messageDigest.update(bytes,0,bytes.length);
return 
Base64.getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding().encodeTOString(digest);



}

###################################

for abve code you will get something similar to "ZQNn8kfypf2X6jOHFdoApXgndA1LJr2-jm6kKJgsNDQ" (a stream)which is the "code_challenge" value
you will use to need to use it for FIRST HTTP request to  authorization code

#########################################








$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$8. PKCE Demo. Requesting Authorization Code$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


BETTER THING IS TO WATCH THIS
HERE WE USE HTTP GET REQUEST

###########CODE TO GENERATE code_verifier and code_challenge (also the main calss)in java############

Main class

public class PkceExample{
public static void main(String[] args){
String codeVerifier=pkce.generateCodeVerifier();

String codeCahllenge=pkce.generateCodeChallenge(codeVerifier);

}catch(UnsupportedEncodingException|NoSuchAlgorithmException ex){
Logger.getLogger(PkceExample.calss.getName(),log(Level.SERVER,null,ex);
}

}


PkceUtil class

public class PkceUtil{
tring generateCodeVerifier() throws UnsupportedEncodingException{
SecureRandom secureRandom=new SecureRandom();
byte[] codeVerififer=new byte[32];
secureRandom.nextBytes(codeVerififer);
retrun
Base64.getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding().encodeTOString(codeVerifier);
}


STRING grenerateCodeChallange(String codeVerifier) throws UnsupportedEncodingException,NoSuchAlgorithmException{
byte[] bytes=codeVerifier.getBytes("US-ASCII");
MessageDigest messageDigest=MessageDigest.getInstnace("SHA-256");
messageDigest.update(bytes,0,bytes.length);
return 
Base64.getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding().encodeTOString(digest);



} 


}


#######################################################


FOR EVERY NEW AUTHORIZATION CODE VALUE WE ASK FROM AUTHORIZATION SERVER WE NEED A NEW TO GERNERATE "code_challenge" VALUE



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$9. PKCE Demo. Exchanging Code for Access Token#$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$




Here we will do a HTTP POST(TO /token end point) REQUEST FOR A ACCESS TOKEN

for this we will use KEY CLOCK identity provider
and ACCESS  MANAGMENT SERVER


TIME -0.58 PRACTICAL STARTS

'client_ecret" value is provided in the KEY CLOACK SERVER
'code' the authorization we got for previous request
'redirect_uri'-this must match the value we earlier used in GET request sosimply copy from previous request


TIME 03.32 -ALL THE PARAMWETERS WE NEED TO SEND THE HTTP POST REQUEST IN ORDER TO EXCAHNG THE AUTHORIZATION CODE  WITH ACCESS TOKEN

QUESTION -WHAT IS KEY CLOACK SERVER??


TIEM 03.39 -GRABBING THE AITHORIZATION CODE THAT WAS GENERATED(THIS WAS ACTUALLY DONE IN PRECVIOUS VIDEO BUT DUE TO TIME LIMIT OF 10 MINS THE THE PREVIOUS AUTHORISATION CODE HAS EXPIRED)



NOEW IN THE POST REQUEST FOR 'CODE' VALUE USE THE NEWLY GENERATED 'AUTHORIZAATION_CODE'

FINALLY i WILL PROVIDE A NEW "CODE-VERIFIER" VALUE THAT WE HAVE JUST GENERATE

***************IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!ALL THE LAST 3 STEPS ARE DONE BECAUSE THE LIFE SPAN OF 10 MINS IN OUR AUTHORIZATION CODE WE GOT FROM INITAL GET REQUET IN PREVIOUS VIDEO
OTHERWIE WE CAN EASILY SKIP THOE STEPS
ONCE YOU GENERATE A NEW AUTHORIZATION CODE A NEW CODE VERIFIER FOR TAHT CODE IS GENERATED SO WE NEED TO CAHNGE BOTH SEEE THE CODE IN PREVIOUS VIDEO SECTION ABOVE**************


TIME 04.26 -WE GOT ACCESS-TOKEN
REFRESH TOKEN 
EXPIRE IN ETC....

IN JSON

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$10Client CREDENTIALS$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

ANOTHER GRANT TYPE
THIS HAPPENS FROM ONE APPLICATION TO ANOTHER APPLICATION AUTHORIZATION(MACHINE TO MACHINE REQUEST)

THERE IS NO USER INVOLVED IN THIS APPLICATON
NO LOGIN PAGE FOR UER TO TYPE UN AND PW



TIME 0.30-HOW IT HAPPENS

HAPPENS IN MACHINE TO MACHINE APPLICATION
THIS MEANS CLIENT IS MOSTLY AN APPLICATION RUNNING ON SERVER SIDE 
FOR EXAMPLE THIS CAN BE  A SPRING BOOT MICRO SERVICE  APPLICATION THAT NEEDS DATA FROM ANOTHER SPRING BOOT APPLICATION


IF ONE MS NEEDS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANOTHER THEN IT WILL SEND THE REQUEST TO "AUTHORIZATION SERVER" TO REQUEST AN ACCEESS TOKEN
THIS TIME CIENT WILL SEND HTTP POST REQUEST DIRECTLY TO A TOKEN END POINT(which is in authorization erver earlier grant types we did GET request firt here only POST)
T WILL SPECIFY "client_credentials" as grant_type (data-urlencoded)
it will provide "email" as scope( TIME 01.11 )
and authorization server to VALDDATE this request the request will ALO CONTAIN CLIENT CREDENTAILS THESE  ARE CLIENT ID(client_id) and CLIENT SECRET (client_secret)
TIME 01.24 
AND IF CLIENT CREDENTIAL GETS VALIDATED AUTHORIZATION SERVER WILL RESPONSE WITH AN ACCES TOKEN IMMEDIETLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

HAVING GOT THE ACCESS TOKEN NOW THE CLIENT SERVER(MOST PROBABLY A MS HERE) CAN SEND A REQUEST TO THE RESOURCE SERVER WITH THAT ACCESS TOKEN

TIME 01.39 - IMAGE HIGH LEVEL





$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$11. Client Credentials Grant Type Demo$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$




WATCH VIDEO ONLY 2.30 MINUTES


WE UE ONLY POST HERE NO GET
AND WE DIRECTLY SEND THE REQUEST TO /TOKEN END POINT



QUETION -WHAT IS redirect_uri and how to ue it
ANSWER-The redirect_uri is an address used by OAuth providers as a location to deliver the access_token by means of a browser redirect

we ent 'client_id' and "client_ecret"
if we are succes we get 100 http status code access token ,refresh _token,etc......

time 2.13 minutes

ONLY USE IF YOUR APPLICATION DOESNT SUPPORT REDIRECT OTHERWISE IF YOUR APPLICATION IS
WEB APP OR MOBILE APP TATH USES REDIRECTION USE AUTHORIZATION CODE OR PKCE AUTHORIZATION CODE GRANT FLOW
IF THE USER TRUST YOUR APPLICATION AND IF THE USER IS READY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH PASSWORD THEN USE PASSWORD GRANT TYPE ALTHOUHGH THE LATTEST OAUTH DOCUMENT BEST PRACTICES PASSWORD GRANT TYPE IS DISSALLOWED ENTIERLY

CAN ALO BE USEFUL WHEN YOU NEED TO MIGRATE EXISTING CLIENTS BY CONVERTING  THERIR STORED CREDENTAILS TO AN OAUTH ACCESS TOKEN
