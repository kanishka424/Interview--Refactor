$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$1.INTRODUCTION$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


WE WILL LEARN 
A VERY POPULAR IDENTITY AND ACCES MANAGMENT SERVER 
THAT SUPPORTS oPENiD CONNECT AND oAUTH 2 FLOWS

IT IS CALLED KEYCLOACK


TIME 0.23 IMAGE HERE WE HAVE DEPICT  FOUR DIFFERENT  PARTCIPENTS OF oAUTH FLOWS
1.RESOURCE OWNER-USER
2.CLIENT(CAN BE A WEBSITE,MOBILE APP,ETC...)
3.RESOURCES SERVER (CAN BE SINGLE SERVER MONOLITHIC APPLICATION THAT EXPOE FEW END POINTS OR IT COULD BE SET OF DIFFERENT SMALL MS THAT ARE RUNNING BEHIND AN API GATEWAY  )
4.AUTHORIZATION SERVER(*****THIS IS WHERE KEYCLOACK CAN BE USED)(THERE IS AWS COGINITA,OKTA,MICROSOFT IDENTITY PLATFORM,SPRINGBOOT AUTHOIZATION SERVER,KAEYCLOACK,ETCC,)


TIME 1.51
1.kEYCLOACK IS OPEN SOURCE IDENTITY AND ACCES MANAGMENT SOLUTIONS
YOU CAN USE KEY CLOACK TO ADD AUTHENTICATION TO APPLICATION  AND SECURE SERVICES WITHMINIMUM AMOUNT OF WORK
KEY CLOAK PROVIDE WITH YOU WITH BOTH WEB INTERFACE TO MANAGE USERS OF THE APPLICATION 
AS WELL AS WITH REST API WHERE YOU CAN ADD NEW AND MANAGE EXISTING USERS

KEYCLOAK IS OPEN SOURCE YOU CAN DOWNLAOD AND RUN IT AS STANDALONE IN YOU SERVER
YOU CAN INTEGRATE IT WITH EXISTING SPRING BOOT APPLICATION 
AND YOU CAN ALSO  RUN IT AS DOCKER  CONTATINERS AND USE WITH KUBERNATE

2.KEYCLOAK SUPPORTS SINGLE SIGN ON(SSO) AND SIGN OUT
THIS MEAN ONCE THE USER IS LOGGED INTO ONE APPLICATION USER DOESNT HAVE TO LOG INTO OTHER APPLICATIONS AGAIN
AND ALSO IF THE USER LOGS OUT OF ONE APPLICATION IT WOULD BE LOGGED OUT OF OTHER APPLICATIONS AS WELL

3.SUPPORTS SOCIAL LOGIN
YOU CAN LOG INTO APPLICATION WITH YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK ACOOUNTS(FB,GGOLE,TWITTER,GITHUB)
KEYCLAOCK CAN ALSO AUTHENTICATE USERS WITH EXISITING OPENID CONNECT OR SOME OTHER ID PROVIDERS THERE IS NOT MUCH WORK THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE IT WORK



4.USER FEDERATION

IF YOUR ORGANISATION HAS SOME EXISTING DB IT CAN ALSO BE INTEGRATE WITH KEY CLOACK
KAEYCLOACK ALSO SUPPORT EXITING "LDAP"  AND ACTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICES
AND YOU CAN ALSO IMPLEMENT YOR OWN PROVIDER AND INTEGRATE KEY CLOACK  WITH MYSQL
FOR EXAMPLE

TIME 3.32 -KEYCLOACK -WEBSITE INTERFACE THAT LETYOU MANAGE OAUTH CLIENT APPLICATION.
UERS THEIR CREDENTIALS  AND THEIR ROLES YOU CAN SELECT WHAT OAUTH GRANT TYPE ARE SUPPORTED NY YOUR APPLICATIONS
YOU CAN CREATE NEW CLIENT SECRET KEYS
CAN CREATE CLIENT SCOPES

AND DEFIENE FINE GRAIN  AUTHORIZATION PROCESS

THE INTERFACE IS MUCH ENHANCED


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$2. Starting up Standalone Authorization Server Keyclock$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


just watch iny 2 mins



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$3. Starting and Stopping Keycloak Server$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

**the video is outdated on how to start



go to D:\SE Software\keycloak-18.0.0\bin

and uing cmd do "bin/kc.bat start-dev"

so the kEYCLOACK wil satrt

this will make the keyclaock ui disaplay in port 8080 by default but we can cahnge t the port (search for it how to do in windows)


we can run two keycloack server in same machine like in video

can stop one using ctrl_c in cmd




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4.Creating an initial Admin User$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



there will be no user name or pw initial in keycloack

we need to create an initial admin user

for the very first time you will see a pane l called "Administrational panel"
create a new user and register a user and pw

watch video short

user-kanishka
pw-malpana24


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$444




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$45. Creating a new Realm$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



now there is no longer an otion to create a  user in interface(localhost:8080 )



relam -IS LIKE A TENANT IN KEYCLOACK SERVER
IT IS A SPACE TO ALLOW MANAGE SET OF USERS THERE ROLES AND ALSO THEIR CREDENTIALS
WHEN USER LOGS IN THEY LOG INTO THIS RELAM
ONE RELAM IS ISOLATED FROM ANOTHER RELAM

WHEN KEYLOCK IS STARTED IT CREATE MASTER RELAM
AND WE CREATE OUR INITIAL ADMIN USER IN THIS MASTER REALM

MASTER RELAM IS AT THE TOP OF OTHER RELAMS AND IT IS AT THE TOP OF OTHER RELAMS
CALL ADMIN REALMS IN MASTER RELAM HAS ACCESS TO MANAGE ANY OTHER RELAM CREATED ON THE SERRVER.
WE ARE IN MASTER RELAM
IT IS RECOMMANDED NOT TO USE MASTER RELAMS FOR REGULA USERS MASTER RELA IS FOR SUPER ADMINS SO THEY CAN MANAGE AND CREATE OTHER RELAMS IN THIS SERVER


TIME 2.35-CREATING NEW RELAM



in the new relam we create we can create as many regular users as we like









$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$6. Creating a new user$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$




DO AS VIDEO ONLY 2.45

YOU CAN CREATE A MEW USER BY 
1.WEB INTERFACE
2.COMMAND LINE
3.URL(http://localhost:8080/auth/relams/{nameofrelam}/account


if you put the pw as temporary 
then you will be directed to define a new pw next time




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$47. Creating a new OAuth client application$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


to create a new Oauth client application
you need to login to a keycloak server as an admin user cand select "Relam"
for which the client application neeeds to be created



after login in select the relam you need to create the new oauth client application in



go to client ection and click create button on upper left to create a new client



TIME 01.07-IN ADD CLIENT PAGE "Cleint ID" is the id to use in OAuth  authorization  flow
here in thi add client you only need to provide ["client ID"value
create one for the standard authorization flow which is AUTHORIZATION CODE GRANT TYPE


here we provide it as "photo-app-code-flow-cclient"
for "client protocol" select "openid connect" or "saml"
we choose "openid connect" 

QUETON WHAT ARE SAML AND OPEN ID

root url we donr provide heree


by diffault this client is configured to work with STANDERED AUTHORIZATION CODE GRANT TYPE

because "standard flow Enabled" is on

also "valid Redirect URL" must be provided by us(which is required)



acces type is "public"

we talked about public vs confidential client types
public-cant gurantee the confidentiality of their secret key e.g-single page js applications


make implicit flow and direct access grant disabled


"valid Redirect URL" -where authorization server would redirect next after user succesfully authenticates  with this server
i dont have a client app like website or mobile app ready
to provide a url here so  provide tempory one "http://localhost:8083/callback"

*********iMPORT***********8888SO ONCE THE USER SUCCESFULY AUTHORIZE WITH AUTHORIZATION SERVER WE WILL REDIRECT TO THIS URL ABOVE( "http://localhost:8083/callback") AND IT WILL ATTACH THE AUTHORIZATION CODE TO THIS URL



NOW SAVE DETAIL IN THIS FORM AND GENERATE A SECRET KEY FOR THIS CLIENT









$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$8. Configuring Client Application Secrets$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


WE HAVE CREATED A NEW OAUTH CLIENT APPLICATION BUT THIS TIME ITS  A PUBLIC TYPE APPLICATION 
FOR PUBLIC TYPE APPLICATION KEYCLOACK DOESNT EVEN ALLOW TO GENERATE CLIENT SECRET VALUES 
SO TO GENERATE CLIENT ECRET VALUES WE NEED TO CAHNGE APPLICATION VALUE FROM "Public" 
to "confidential"  and save setting

and now you can see a new tab on the same page as "credentials" there you can see the 
"secret"(client secret)  or you can regenerate it(for  new value)
at top we have client id(photo-app-code-flow-cclient) and now we have client secret

****now we have oauth client app created we have client id  and client secret created
WE CAN PERFORM ONE OF AUTHS AUTHORIZATION FLOWS



$$$$$$$$$$$9. Requesting Access Token and Refresh Token$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



BEter to watch video!!!!
HERE WE ARE SENDING A POSYMAN GET REQUEST TO OUR NEWLY CREATED CLIENT APPLICATION 
the value is "response_type" is code because wwe use AUTHORIZATION CODE
the redirect_uri in postamn should MATCH the redirect uri in  Keylock client application we created in earlier two videos
IF NOT THE REQUEST WONT WORK!




COPY THE URL YOU CRREATED (TIME 1.19)(WE CREATED THE URL TO /AUTH ENDPOINT IN KEYLOACK) IN A BROWSER
AND YOU WILL BE DIRECTED TO A LOGIN PAGE
IF THE AUTHENTICATION IS SUCCESSFUL YOU WILL BE REDIRECTED TO THE :redirect_uri" we passed(and gave the same in creating client application in keyclaock)(time 01.36 we have provide a random url in that nothing is running that why "the site cant be reached")
****important****the authorization server while redirecting attach the AUTHORIZATION CODE TO THE END OF THE URL!!!!(TIME 01.42)


TIME 1.49 HERE WE WILL SEND THE POST REQUEST THAT WILL BE USED TO EXCAHNGE THIS
AUTHORIZATION CODE  FOR AN ACCESSS TOKEN !!
IN THE POSTAMNS POST TAB (NOT THE GET ONE WE EARLIER USED THIS IS FOR POST)
FOR THE VALUE OF "code" COPY AND PAST THE AUTHORIZATION CODE WE RECEIVED FROM AUTHORIZATION SERVER EARLIER
ALSO PROVIDE correct "client_id" and "client_secret" we have provided in ourr keyloack client application,copy and paste fro server
"scope" is openid profile
"redirect_uri" would be the same value as we gave to our INITIAL GET request copy and paste
(remember authorization code ususally expire in less than 10 mins before that you have to use it in post request to get the access token)


after that you get access token and id token
QUESTION-ID TOKEN???WAHT IS THAT

NOW WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE OAUTH AUTHORIZATION CODE GRANT TYPE





$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$10. EnableDisable OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

watch video!

2.5 mins


we can make the same option enabled( when creating client application server) for PKCE
but additional settings you need to enable
  
to do that go to "ADVANCED SETTING"
and elect 's256' for "product key for code exchange code challenge method"(if you selected empty PKCE wont work)


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$11. OAuth 2.0 Client Scopes$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

SHOULD MAKE A NOTE
