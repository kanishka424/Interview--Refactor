SELF-JOIN

A table is joined to itself

comparing values in a column of rows wihin the same table

can be viewed as two copies joined of the same table


the table is not actullay copied but sql performs it as though it where


THERE IS NO SPECIAL KEYWORD SIMPLY STANDARD "JOIN" WITH THE SAME TABLE IN BOTH PARTS

HOWEVER WHEN USING SELF-JOIN IT IS NECESSARY TO USE AN ALIAS FOR THE TABLE OTHERWISE THE TABLE NAMES WOULD BE AMBIGUOUES

*****syntaxt

SELECT tableA.col,tableB.col
FROM table AS tableA
JOIN table AS tableB ON
tableA.some_col=table.other_col


***tableA and tableB refers to same table


eg-time 3.03

where emloyee reports to another emplyee
in EM[PLOYEES table
e.g-software engineer to Tech lead]


ref -self join graphical

SELECT emp.col ,report.col AS rep
FROM employees AS emp
JOIN employees AS report ON
emp.emp_id=report.report_id
