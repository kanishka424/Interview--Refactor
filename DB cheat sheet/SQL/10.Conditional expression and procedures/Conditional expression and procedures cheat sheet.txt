$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 2.CASE$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


two main ways to use
1.general CASE
2.CASE expression

we use 
        CASE
        WHEN
        THEN
        ELSE
        END

SELECT a,
CASE WHEN a=1 THEN 'one'//a is the column
CASE WHEN a=2 THEN 'two'
ELSE 'other' AS label//this will overide efault column name 'case' to label
END
FROM test

a is the column

we create another column for results and it is by deafult called 'Case' but we can change it


ref-CASE example




CASE expression

first evaluates an ecxpression then compares the result  with each value 
in the WHENclauses
sequentially


Rewriting our previous exampl



SELECT a,
    CASE a WHEN 1 THEN 'one'//the "a" is the difference compare with above
        WHEN 2 THEN 'two'
        ELSE 'other'
    END AS results
    FROM test;


    time 18.01 watch an advaanced sceanrio but easy actually

e.g-
SELECT customer_id,
CASE 
	WHEN (customer_id<=100) THEN 'Preium'
	WHEN (customer_id BETWEEN ) THEN 'Plus'
	ELSE 'Normal'
END AS customer_class
FROM customer
 

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE rental_rate
        WHEN 0.99 THEN 1
        ELSE 0
        END)AS baragins
        FROM film




***we use case in SELECt



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 4.COALESCE $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

returns the first not null value if null returns null


SELECT item,(price-COALESCE(discount,0))//return 0 if discount  //discount is the column
AS final FROM table



can use if you have null values in table






$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 5.CAST$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


not 100% 



SELECT CAST ('5' AS INTEGER) as new_int FROM rental


****to use string functions on int we can use cast



SELECT CHAR_LENGTH(CAST(inventory_id AS VARCHAR)) FROM rental



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 6.NULL IF$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

NULLIF(10,10)-true



SELECT(
    SUM(CASE WHEN department='A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    NULL IF(SUM(CASE WHEN department='B' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),0)//if 0 it would return null
     
) AS dept_ratio
FROM depts

dividing y zero returns an error divide by null retrurrns null




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 7.VIEW$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



virtula table


CREATE VIEW customer_info AS//only different part
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM customer_id
INNER JOIN address
ON customer.address_id=address.address_id



ALTER A VIEW  


CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_info AS//this is the only different part
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM customer_id,age
INNER JOIN address
ON customer.address_id=address.address_id


DROP  VIEW customer_info

ALTER VIEW customer_ifo RENAME to c_info
