1.when you put the same key again in a map the value get overriden

2.map.containsKey("ab") //return boolean
we can use this to avoid overriding values when ading the same key with a different value

3.printing key and value

for(String key:languages.keySet()){
sout(key+":"+languages.get(key));
}

in a map we don't have in order
